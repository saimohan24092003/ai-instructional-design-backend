## Response Structure

### Domain Classification
```json
{
  "primaryDomain": "Technology & IT",
  "confidence": 92,
  "reasoning": "This content is classified as Technology & IT because it contains specific programming concepts such as API development, database design, and software architecture patterns",

}
```

### Quality Assessment with Justifications
```json
{
  "overallScore": 84,
  "clarityScore": 87,
  "clarityJustification": "Clarity is 87% because the content uses clear technical terminology with adequate explanations and logical structure",
  "completenessScore": 82,
  "completenessJustification": "Completeness is 82% because it covers most essential topics but lacks hands-on exercises",
  "engagementScore": 78,
  "engagementJustification": "Engagement potential is 78% because it includes code examples but needs more interactive elements",
  "currencyScore": 89,
  "currencyJustification": "Currency is 89% because it uses recent technology versions and current best practices"
}
```

### Gap Analysis with Recommendations
```json
{
  "identifiedGaps": [
    {
      "type": "Assessment",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "Content lacks evaluation mechanisms to validate learning progress",
      "recommendation": "Implement progressive assessments and practical coding projects"
    },
    {
      "type": "Practical Application",
      "severity": "Medium",
      "description": "Theory-heavy content with limited hands-on practice opportunities",
      "recommendation": "Add coding laboratories and real-world project simulations"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content-Specific SME Questions
```json
[
  {
    "question": "What development tools and environments will learners have access to during training?",
    "category": "implementation",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you currently measure coding proficiency and adherence to best practices?",
    "category": "metrics",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the most common technical challenges your developers face with this technology stack?",
    "category": "challenges",
    "priority": "high"
  }
]
```

## Frontend Integration Guide

### 1. Upload Content
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('files', file);

const response = await fetch('/api/content/upload-and-analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});

const result = await response.json();
const sessionId = result.data.sessionId;
```

### 2. Poll for Analysis Results
```javascript
async function checkAnalysisStatus(sessionId) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/content/analysis-status/${sessionId}`);
  const result = await response.json();

  if (result.data.status === 'completed') {
    displayProfessionalAnalysis(result.data.professionalAnalysis);
    displaySMEQuestions(result.data.contentSpecificSMEQuestions);
  } else {
    // Continue polling
    setTimeout(() => checkAnalysisStatus(sessionId), 2000);
  }
}
```

### 3. Display Analysis Results
```javascript
function displayProfessionalAnalysis(analysis) {
  // Show domain classification with reasoning
  document.getElementById('domain').textContent = analysis.domainClassification.primaryDomain;
  document.getElementById('domain-reasoning').textContent = analysis.domainClassification.reasoning;

  // Show complexity with justification
  document.getElementById('complexity').textContent = analysis.complexityAssessment.level;
  document.getElementById('complexity-reasoning').textContent = analysis.complexityAssessment.reasoning;

  // Show quality scores with justifications
  document.getElementById('clarity-score').textContent = analysis.qualityAssessment.clarityScore + '%';
  document.getElementById('clarity-justification').textContent = analysis.qualityAssessment.clarityJustification;

  // Show suitability with color coding
  const suitabilityElement = document.getElementById('suitability');
  suitabilityElement.textContent = analysis.suitabilityAssessment.level;
  suitabilityElement.className = `suitability-${analysis.suitabilityAssessment.colorCode.toLowerCase()}`;

  // Show gap analysis
  displayGaps(analysis.gapAnalysis.identifiedGaps);

  // Show enhancement suggestions
  displayEnhancements(analysis.enhancementSuggestions);
}
```

### 4. Handle Unsuitable Content
```javascript
function handleSuitabilityAssessment(suitability) {
  if (suitability.colorCode === 'RED') {
    showError(`Content Not Suitable: ${suitability.recommendation}`);
    disableNextSteps();
  } else if (suitability.colorCode === 'YELLOW') {
    showWarning(`Enhancements Needed: ${suitability.recommendation}`);
    showEnhancementSuggestions();
  } else {
    showSuccess(`Excellent Content: ${suitability.recommendation}`);
    enableNextSteps();
  }
}
```
