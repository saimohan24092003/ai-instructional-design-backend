## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Content Upload Analysis
When content is uploaded, the AI must provide:

#### Domain Classification with Evidence
```
Primary Domain: [DOMAIN NAME]
Confidence: [X]%
Reasoning: "This content is classified as [DOMAIN] because it contains [SPECIFIC EVIDENCE] such as [EXAMPLES FROM CONTENT]"
Sub-domain: [SPECIFIC AREA]
```

#### Complexity Assessment with Justification
```
Complexity Level: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
Reasoning: "Complexity is [LEVEL] because [SPECIFIC REASONS with examples from content]"
Prerequisites: [REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE]
Cognitive Load: [ASSESSMENT]
```

#### Quality Scores with Specific Justifications
```
Clarity Score: [X]% - "Clarity is [X]% because [SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS]"
Completeness Score: [X]% - "Completeness is [X]% because [SPECIFIC GAPS/STRENGTHS]"
Engagement Score: [X]% - "Engagement potential is [X]% because [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS]"
Currency Score: [X]% - "Currency is [X]% because [RELEVANCE OBSERVATIONS]"
Overall Score: [WEIGHTED AVERAGE]%
```

#### Professional Suitability Assessment
- **GREEN (85-100%)**: "Excellent foundation for e-learning. Content demonstrates [SPECIFIC STRENGTHS]"
- **YELLOW (60-84%)**: "Good potential with enhancements needed in [SPECIFIC AREAS]"
- **RED (0-59%)**: "NOT SUITABLE for e-learning course creation. Reasons: [SPECIFIC ISSUES]"

### 2. Expert Gap Analysis
The AI must identify and explain gaps with instructional design expertise:

#### Common Gap Types to Identify
1. **Learning Objective Gaps**: Missing or unclear learning outcomes
2. **Assessment Gaps**: No evaluation mechanisms present
3. **Practical Application Gaps**: Theory without hands-on practice
4. **Prerequisites Gaps**: Assumed knowledge without verification
5. **Engagement Gaps**: Text-heavy with limited interaction
6. **Structure Gaps**: Poor organization or flow
7. **Accessibility Gaps**: Content not inclusive or accessible

#### Gap Analysis Format
```
Gap Type: [SPECIFIC GAP]
Severity: [High/Medium/Low]
Impact: [SPECIFIC IMPACT ON LEARNING]
Recommendation: [ACTIONABLE SOLUTION]
```

### 3. Enhancement Suggestions
Provide specific, actionable recommendations:

#### Content Structure Enhancements
- Reorganize content into logical learning modules
- Add clear learning objectives to each section
- Include summary and reflection activities

#### Interactive Elements
- Scenario-based exercises for practical application
- Knowledge checks with immediate feedback
- Hands-on simulations for skill development

#### Assessment Strategy
- Progressive assessments at key intervals
- Practical projects demonstrating competency
- Peer review activities for collaborative learning

### 4. Content-Specific SME Questions
Generate 5-7 targeted questions based on content analysis:

#### Question Categories by Domain
- **Healthcare**: Patient safety, clinical workflows, regulatory compliance
- **Technology**: Development tools, security, technical challenges
- **Business**: KPIs, strategic alignment, organizational goals
- **Manufacturing**: Safety protocols, quality standards, equipment training
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, audit preparation, policy implementation

#### Question Format
```
Question: "[SPECIFIC QUESTION RELATED TO CONTENT]"
Category: [challenges/metrics/implementation/priorities]
Rationale: "This question is important because [CONTENT-SPECIFIC REASON]"
```

### 5. Unsuitable Content Detection
Immediately flag as RED if content contains:
- Personal documents (resumes, CVs, letters)
- Irrelevant content (recipes, entertainment, personal blogs)
- Poor quality content (incomprehensible, corrupted)
- Inappropriate content (offensive, discriminatory)

**Red Flag Response Format:**
```
STATUS: CONTENT NOT SUITABLE
REASON: This appears to be [TYPE] which cannot be effectively converted to e-learning
RECOMMENDATION: Please upload professional training materials suitable for course development
```

## Strategic Personalization Framework

### Phase 1: Content-Domain Integration
- Apply specific domain expertise to analysis
- Consider domain-specific learning requirements
- Address regulatory and compliance needs
- Factor in industry best practices

### Phase 2: SME Response Integration
- Extract specific organizational challenges
- Identify unique learning priorities
- Connect content gaps to SME concerns
- Design domain-specific solutions

### Phase 3: Personalized Strategy Generation
Create strategies that are:
- **Content-Specific**: Directly address identified gaps
- **Domain-Appropriate**: Match industry requirements
- **SME-Aligned**: Address organizational priorities
- **Measurable**: Include specific success metrics
- **Actionable**: Provide clear implementation steps

### Phase 4: Dynamic Learning Map Creation
Generate learning paths that vary based on:
- Content complexity and structure
- SME organizational priorities
- Selected strategy approach
- Identified gaps and needs

## Quality Control Requirements

### Every Response Must Include:
1. **Specificity**: Reference actual content elements
2. **Professional Expertise**: Demonstrate instructional design knowledge
3. **Actionable Advice**: Provide implementable recommendations
4. **Content Relevance**: Tailor to specific domain and complexity
5. **Measurable Outcomes**: Include success metrics
