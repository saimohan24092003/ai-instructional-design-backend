### Phase 4: Content-Specific SME Questions
Generate 5-7 targeted questions based on content analysis:

**Template**: "Based on your [DOMAIN] content focusing on [SPECIFIC TOPICS], I need to understand your organizational context:"

1. **Content-Specific Context**: "What specific challenges do your learners face when applying [SPECIFIC SKILL FROM CONTENT] in real-world situations?"

2. **Organizational Priorities**: "Which aspects of [CONTENT TOPIC] are most critical for your team's performance goals?"

3. **Skill Application**: "How do you currently measure proficiency in [SPECIFIC COMPETENCIES FROM CONTENT]?"

4. **Learning Environment**: "What tools/systems will learners have access to when applying [CONTENT SKILLS] on the job?"

5. **Success Metrics**: "How will you measure the success of this [CONTENT DOMAIN] training program?"
